# Hello sir, here is the summary of the above 3 file 

1. Fake_News_Detection [EDA, ML, LSTM].ipynb -> contains the whole EDA portion with and without Pre-processing. It also contains the some correlation like if fake news have more word/sentence or real news have more. Naive bayes and SVM used for basic model build up. For RNN, Bi-directional LSTM used.

2. Fake_News_Detection_Bidirectional_LSTM.ipynb -> it only contains the the RNN part. I go an accuracy of  96.5%. Compared to kaggle .5% less.

3. LSTM_using_Glove.ipynb -> I tried glove, may be i made some mistake in here. I got poor accuracy for in this case
